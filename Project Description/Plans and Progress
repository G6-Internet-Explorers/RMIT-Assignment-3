This text file will contain the full 4 page document of the plans and progress of the Garden mates project

The origins of this project came about we thought on how many times people have killed plants because of the lack of knowledge. Usually we hear about this complaint among friends who would buy numerous potted plants and then eventually saying that they died for some unknown reason or didn’t have the time. Then they would purchase another plant and the story would then again repeat itself. This is very costly and is quite common in the average household. Many people do not know how to properly look after their plants. Even if they wanted to, it would be hard to do so, as there is quite a bit of reading to go about it in order to understand the complexity of plant growth. The project seeks to bridge the gap for average people, but also giving the choice to go deeper into agricultural studies. We believe an application, which can assist in the education and automation of gardening. 
This can be seen with reducing plant re-purchases, maintenance costs and time. Giving key resources to develop your garden further into automation by integrating with the smart home reality that society is moving towards. Where controlling key systems to tend your garden like the sprinklers, which can easily give plants what they need when you are not available. Learning how many benefits this can bring to not only the close friends we know, but to people we have not met yet. Giving us the motivation to develop this application and help change society.
