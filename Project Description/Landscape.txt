There are a lot of different plant devices, some of them are more like Garden Mates and some are less. For example, a device which is capable to measure soil moisture, temperature, and light and automatically water your plant with the built in water pump. Or another one, self-contained automatic watering pot consisting of a soil sensor as well as the water reservoir built into a cavity in the pot.
There is a competition between automatic and non-automatic plant watering and monitoring systems. The most leading ones are PlantMaid and Parrot Pot.
Garden Mates is quite similar to Parrot Pot but the distinguish feature of it is a sensor device that can be added not only to a pot plant, but also to larger devices. So it can be used in agricultural development.
