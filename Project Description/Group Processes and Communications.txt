We have found that communications have been as per previous assignment, very smooth and productive. The tools we used mostly were Microsoft Teams and Zoom Cloud Meeting. Our team members would poll for a time that was suitable for everyone and fortunately we would all be able to come together once per week.
This assignment however our communication was slightly different to the last one as previously our assignment was taking place over Christmas and New Year. This assignment however was more demanding on communications for us as the majority of our team members had to return demanding work commitments and some members were dealing with getting children back to school or returning home from holidays.
Most often during our cloud meetings we would close by agreeing on a time for the next meeting. In the beginning once tasks were divided it would we would meet once a week but towards the final three weeks, often enough we would try to meet every three days to check on each other progress or assist each other if there were difficulties.
Our team agrees that because this was a new project, ideally to meet in person at a conference table and sketch the plans, our ideas and notes on a whiteboard would of certainly been the most effective. Communicating via web conferencing once the project is up and running is fine, but the initial in person meeting would unquestionably have gotten us started of much smoother.
We did not have any group members not responding other than the two members as previous assignment that were uncontactable. It was easy to see via Microsoft Teams that members were checking messages at least once a day and being involved in the discussions and problem solving. As per previous assignment, we had already agreed that ff for some reason a member was not responding, the tasks would be divided up and each member would volunteer to take on the task.
