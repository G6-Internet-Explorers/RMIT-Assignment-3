I have quite enjoyed the team work this group has shown. Seeing everyone in the group being open to their own project ideas and ideas on presentation have been amazing to witness. I have been amazed at everyone’s availabilities and willingness to contribute new ideas. I was surprised with everyone’s involvement even though we all live far from each other. Getting to understand the journey each group member has been on to get to this point has been very interesting. Being in a group has opened me up to different perspectives within the I.T industry. Allowing me to expand my knowledge base and develop my skillset with team work. I believe we can improve with a better project management system, as GitHub has helped in collating our information to a certain degree. It has not proved to be very useful with communication in the collaboration process. We did use Microsoft Teams to improve on communication within the team, but seem to have its own limitations with how posts are organised. Otherwise, working with this group has been an enjoyable experience and I look forward to working with such a good bunch of people in the future.
