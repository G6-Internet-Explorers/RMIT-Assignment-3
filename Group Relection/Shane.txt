I was very happy to of had the opportunity to again be part of the G6 Internet Explorers. After having ironed out a lot of the anxiety bugs that I experienced with assignment one, our team on this assignment from the first meeting was already to step up and assume responsibilities and put our best foot forward.

This assignment also I feel went smoother as we had now all had some experience working with GitHub. By downloading the GitHub desktop app, we could easily insert and edit all file formats. Previously we were restricted to editing text files and most of us preferred using Microsoft Word. We did experiment with other platforms this time around but found that Ms Teams and Zoom meetings were the best for our team as we were all familiar with them.

Even with time zone differences, we managed to all get together weekly then biweekly and every other day towards the end of the assignment. Although our team did not nominate a leader, one member was very helpful in starting the GitHub and Teams site and hosting the meetings. During the meetings, all members were quick to volunteer for tasks and I feel they were distributed evenly by agreeing with each other rather than being delegated.

I have enjoyed working with my team and hope to work with them again in the future and catch up for a drink one of these days. I wish them all the best with their studies and careers.
