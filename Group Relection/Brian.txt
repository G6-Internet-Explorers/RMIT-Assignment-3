General
I believe this group is outstanding, having come together fairly organically by placing our names in an available group rather than scouting around looking for people of like interests or in the same town or city. It is our diversity that allows us to present interesting and unique points of view. We have worked well together on common goals. As is evident by the differences in our ideal jobs and the blend of personality types we each bring unique experiences both life and employment to enrich the team. 

What went well.
I believe our team meetings via teleconference were particularly effective as it afforded our geographically dispersed team the same access to live conversation that students studying on campus would have. 

What could be improved.
For the next project I will recommend different project management tools as I underwent some frustration, with Microsoft Teams and the addons, with getting a clear picture of where we were at. 

One thing that was surprising.
One thing that did surprise me was the absolute absence of any conflict. The entire team were at all times respectful of each others ideas and opinions and sought through dialogue to form a conscensus on the best approach to move forward. I have rarely found this in commercial enterprises. 

One thing I have learned about groups.
One thing I have learned about groups is that sometimes you can be really really lucky.  
I look forward to working with all my new ‘mates’ on the next team project.
