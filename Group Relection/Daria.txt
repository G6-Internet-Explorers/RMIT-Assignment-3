I really enjoyed working with everybody in this team. All members of my group are very understanding and friendly people who are easy to negotiate with. There were no problems with setting time for conferences, despite the fact that we live in different time zones. I also think that our group did a great job using the Github. Due to the good organization, it was easy to distribute the work among the team members.
I believe that our group has done a great job and there are almost no things that could be improved. 
When I started working in this team, I was really surprised by apps that our group used for organization and chat. They were really convenient and helpful.
Working as a team, I learned that it is essential to be able to express my thoughts freely about different aspects of the project and to be tolerant and respectful to everybody cause these things are significant for successful teamwork.
